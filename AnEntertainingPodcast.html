    <h2>About the show</h2>

    <p>
     "An Entertaining Podcast" is a weekly show that is focused on the latest news in the entertainment industry. It features discussions that revolve around the latest movies and television shows available on streaming or in theaters. In addition, I also talk about topics that are relevant to this field or reflect on classics.  I will be posting new episodes weekly on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Podbean.
